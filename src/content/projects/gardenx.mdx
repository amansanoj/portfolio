## Overview

My school had been running a student-operated farm for nearly a decade. What started as a small garden had grown into a serious agricultural operation - but the systems managing it hadn't kept up.

My co-founder and I saw the gap, sat down with the school to understand their workflows, and built GardenX: a full-stack platform to replace manual processes with a clean, digital experience for everyone involved.

## The Problem

Produce volume had been doubling almost every year:

	values: [2500, 4200, 6000, 10600, 15000, 20000, 50000, 100000]

By 2024, the school was managing all of this with **3–4 physical ledgers**. Tracking stock levels, recording transactions, generating reports, and organizing cash flow had become a logistical nightmare - and the volume was only going up.

## The Solution

We built a platform that connected every stakeholder in the process:

- **Multi-role ordering** - parents, students, teachers, and local residents could all browse available produce and place orders from their phones.
- **Two pickup counters** - orders were routed to one of two physical pickup points on campus to distribute load and reduce crowding.
- **Flexible payments** - buyers could pay by card at checkout or settle on pickup, whichever worked for them.
- **AI checkout recommendations** - an AI layer analyzed order patterns and surfaced relevant upsells at checkout, boosting average order value.
- **POS mode** - when it became clear most people weren't placing orders in advance, we built a counter-facing POS mode so staff could take orders and process payments on the spot at dispersal.
- **Admin dashboard** - school staff got real-time visibility into stock, pending orders, and transaction history - no ledger required.

## Impact

Processed **30,000+ AED** in produce sales across **4 months** - one of which was winter break and another exam season.

## What I Learned

More went wrong than I expected, and most of it wasn't technical.

Getting parents and local residents to place orders in advance was harder than building the app. Most people just showed up at dispersal and wanted to buy on the spot - so we ended up building a POS mode for the counter staff to handle walk-up orders. That ended up being used more than the self-ordering flow.

A few other things:

- The AI recommendations only felt useful because we put them at checkout, when someone already had buying intent. Anywhere else it would've just been annoying.
- Reporting ended up being more important than the ordering flow. The school needed to know what was paid by card, what was paid on pickup, and what was still pending - that's what replaced the ledgers day-to-day.
- We cut a bunch of features mid-build (subscription boxes, delivery routing, a leaderboard). Probably the right call but at the time it was painful.
- Pickup counters got chaotic during dispersal. Two locations helped but we were basically doing crowd management by the end.

## What's Next

The school is still using the platform. The infrastructure is stable but there's room to grow - better reporting for the school, a public storefront, and potentially expanding the model to other schools with similar programs.
