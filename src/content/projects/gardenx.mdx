## Overview

GardenX is a platform that enables schools to commercialize produce grown by
students in school gardens. It uses AI to personalize orders and streamline
inventory management, creating a closed-loop marketplace between schools and buyers.

Within 4 months of launch, the platform facilitated over 30,000 AED in produce sales.

## The Problem

Schools with active gardening programs had no efficient way to sell excess produce.
Distribution was manual, inconsistent, and disconnected from demand.

## The Solution

A centralized web platform with three core components:

- **AI-driven order personalization** — recommends produce bundles based on buyer history and seasonal availability.
- **Inventory management dashboard** — gives school admins real-time visibility into stock levels and pending orders.
- **App-based order fulfillment** — buyers place and track orders from a mobile-friendly interface.
