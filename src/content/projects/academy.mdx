## Overview

Falak Academy is a course platform built specifically for students and teachers at my school - think Coursera, but scoped to one campus and designed to actually be usable by the people there.

The idea came from a simple observation: there was no easy way for a teacher or a motivated student to publish a course for their peers. Existing platforms were either too complex, too generic, or both. My co-founder (the same one behind [GardenX](/projects/gardenx)) and I built something purpose-fit.

## The Problem

Teachers who wanted to run structured learning initiatives had no good internal tool. Signing up students on third-party platforms meant dealing with account creation, licensing, and interfaces built for a global audience - not a school hallway.

Students who wanted to teach their peers had it even harder. There was no infrastructure at all.

## The Solution

We built a platform where teachers and students could:

- **Create and publish courses** - structured into modules and lessons, with a simple editor that didn't get in the way.
- **Enroll and track progress** - students could self-enroll, work through content at their own pace, and mark lessons complete.
- **See who finished** - course creators had visibility into enrollment and completion, useful for running it as a proper initiative.

## Pilot

We launched with an *Introduction to Git & GitHub* course as the first pilot - aimed at students who'd never touched version control. It ended up with **60+ completions**, which validated that the platform worked and that there was genuine appetite for this kind of peer-to-peer learning.

## What I Learned

- Keeping the course creation flow simple was the whole product. If making a course felt like work, nobody would do it.
- The pilot subject mattered. Git was practical, immediately useful, and something students actually wanted to learn - it drove real sign-ups.
- Running it inside a school community meant word-of-mouth worked fast. No marketing needed.
